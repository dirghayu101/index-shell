# Components to be made:
- Setup API Gateway and Cognito 
- Setup API Gateway and lambda

Demonstration next week:
1- Working CI/CD pipeline.
2- Frontend to make HTTP request getting served from S3 bucket.
3- User authentication and authorization on every HTTP request.
4- All the post method and other APIs working and a corresponding frontend.
5- Tagging algorithm working and data getting successfully stored.


Breakdown:
Step 1: Goal 1: API gateway, Cognito and Lambda communication.
Step 2: CRUD request on this.
Step 3: S3 bucket setup and frontend setup.
Step 4: Pipeline for deploying and working on this.


Step 1: API gateway and lambda communication.

It's very easy, I am just complicating it. I have to copy someone. Copying is part of learning, and by copying I mean I will customize the existing solutions to fit my need.
So, this is what I am going to do:
- I will copy a couple of mini projects, and put all the parts together to create a running thing.
- This is how learning works, once you imitate the process several times, you start seeing pattern, you get a deeper understanding, and you innovate.
- I have realized at this point that there are possibilities of having a lot of problem with the above approach. If at a later stage, a problem occurs then that will be troublesome.
- Let's do one thing, let's have a couple of independent architecture coupled minimally running in our system. <-- Simply means, copy from multiple functioning projects.
- The goal should be to get those projects running not to understand them. 
- Get the project running, and see components with the goal to customize them not to understand them for the time being. I don't have time to take my slow approach to software development.
